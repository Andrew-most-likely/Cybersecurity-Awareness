# Security Policy

## Project Overview

The **Cybersecurity Awareness Dashboard** is a **static website** designed for educational purposes.  
It does **not collect, store, or track any user data**, which means there is **virtually no risk** of security breaches for users.  

Even though the project is low-risk, we take responsible security practices seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a potential vulnerability:

1. **Email**: `andrewcappelli13@gmail.com`  
   Include:
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce it (if applicable)
   - Potential impact

2. **Response Time**: We will acknowledge reports within **3 business days**.  

Since the site is static and contains no sensitive data, the likelihood of a serious vulnerability is extremely low.
